The wines of Washington state continue to gain international accolades and attention for their winemaker’s unique twists on traditional classics. Benefiting from the Yakima Valley’s cool climate, the Porter & Plot Pinot Gris is unlike any Italian Grigio you’ve ever come across. 

Italian Pinot Gs skew toward light-bodied and steely, offering far fewer aromatics than this American interpretation that is bursting with vivacious floral scents and tropical citrus flavors. Its crisp, palate-tingling acidity and mineral kick make it great to pair with halibut, salmon, chicken and Asian cuisine.
