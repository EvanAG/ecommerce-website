Wayward is the realization of the entrepreneurial spirit, a tribute to the independent attitude of the willful trailblazer. Conceived by three friends - all with strong views on winemaking - Wayward Wine is the result of a journey. The three friends made a pact to leave cowboy country and head west to the Golden State with the goal of changing the way people discover and drink wine. Every time you drink Wayward Wine think of it as a message in a bottle, using natural fruits and exciting flavors to tell the story of this trioâ€™s quest.
