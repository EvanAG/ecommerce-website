Torrontés is the hottest thing to arrive from Argentina since the tango. Not to be confused with Spain’s Torrontés (that’s a completely different fruit), the Argentine queen is a leader of the pack. She’s highly aromatic, exuberantly floral, with a rich, hothouse citrus scent - a whiff will have you wondering whether La Reina should be sold as a wine or a perfume. But one sip will have you lining up for another pour of her tropical peach, apricot, and kiwi flavors that come with a crisp, zingy pop. Queue your clique because this ringleader knows how to rock a party.
