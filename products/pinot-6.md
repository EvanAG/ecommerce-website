Emsworth Cellars was founded with tradition in mind and focus on the craft of winemaking. After all, winemaking is a collaborative effort with Mother Nature. Featuring fruits from the Lodi region, this white blend is very aromatically expressive. Floral scents mix with a splash rosewater, but once you taste, lemon custard and pineapple flavors spring to life. It’s a refreshing wine that has an expansive pairing range - from seafood gumbo to Thai curries or even Spanish paella - it will be just as delicious at a 5 o’clock happy hour as it is at a 5-course family meal.
