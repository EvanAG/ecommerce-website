<p>Perched almost exactly between the bustling metropolises of Los Angeles and San Francisco is San Luis Obispo, where the wine county’s initials – SLO – have come to represent their easygoing pace of life. And while the mood may be slower and laid back, that doesn’t mean they don’t take their winemaking seriously. SLO is the birthplace of the Rhone Rangers, an organization that promotes American wines made from the same grapes and techniques as those used for centuries in France’s Rhone River Valley. 

</p>When it comes to winemaking, SLO means employing meticulous efforts that can never be rushed to craft rich, balanced wines with sought-after layers of flavor. Taste the results for yourself in this blend of Grenache, Syrah, Petite Sirah and Mouvedre. With an explosion of ripe blackberry and raspberry fruit, a touch of earthy oak, and a spicy, peppery finish, its flavors are anything but easygoing.</p>
