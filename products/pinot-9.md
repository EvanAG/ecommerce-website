The Pacific Coast climate of Washington’s Columbia Valley is perfect for growing Riesling - the most versatile, complex and food-friendly of all the white grapes. From bone dry to dessert sweet, no other varietal can be crafted to express such a wide array of characteristics. XO marks the spot on the perfect balance between Reisling’s sweet and dry natures. A refreshing change from the slew of Reislings overflowing with sugar, XO will delight you with a kiss of lemon and pineapple flavor and then surprise you with its uncanny ability to lovingly embrace a myriad of dishes full of herbs and spices.
