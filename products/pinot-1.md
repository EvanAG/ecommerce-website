When your evening calls for a taste of a classic beauty, the Rockwell Zinfandel should be at the top of your list. Showcasing original California varietals, Rockwell wines are all about contemporary elegance and the refined notion of sitting down to simply enjoy a great tasting glass. Good wines take great expertise, time and attention to create. 

So if anything, an open bottle provides us the best excuse to slow down, savor the flavors, and appreciate a moment in time. Pour a glass of this silky, sexy Zin. Its full-bodied flavor oozes rich raspberry jam and wild strawberries that will leave you with long, luscious finish. She packs a punch (15.6% alcohol by volume), so there’s not need to rush. This is a glass you’ll want to enjoy sip after sip.
