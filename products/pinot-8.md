Birk O’Halloran is a wine renaissance man. He’s a somm (he has his advanced degree), a wine merchant (he’s launched three successful wine stores), a wine sales rep (he sells wine to top restaurants in NYC) and a winemaker (he launched Iconic Wines in 2010). And did we mention an author? His new book Eat, Ink is a photographic journey into the world of chefs and their tattoos. 

It’s only fitting then, that Birk would name a wine Full Sleeve, an homage to those who are committed to the craft and bear it openly on their tattooed arms. Full Sleeve is a robust white blend of Viognier, which provides juicy peach flavors and subtle hints of honeysuckle, and Sauvignon Blanc, which keeps the wine fresh and lively with a tangy lemon and lime zest finish. This exclusive blend is a burst of rebellion that might just give you the liquid courage to get your own fresh ink.
