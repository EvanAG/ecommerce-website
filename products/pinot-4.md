Chris Condos comes from a large Greek family with a long history of winemaking. For him, the best way to pay respect to his family’s tradition was to fly in the face of convention. Chris is renowned for being on the forefront of organic winemaking and farming practices, launching his first vineyard in 1997 to focus on hand-crafted wines using Advanced Organics - practices that are still considered progressive even by today’s standards. 

Disregarding what may be “en vogue” in the wine world at any given time, Chris is a true Independent who instead believes in following his heart and respecting the harvest. To him, that means finding delicious fruit - whatever varietal it may be - and intervening as little as possible in the grape’s growth to produce wines with finesse and freshness that lets the grape’s natural flavors shine through.
